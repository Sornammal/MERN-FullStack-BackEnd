üñ•Ô∏è Project Structure: Backend (Node.js + Express)

This is the backend portion of your MERN e-commerce app. It handles:

Database interaction (MongoDB via Mongoose)

User authentication

Product, cart, and order APIs

Middleware (auth, file uploads)

Token generation

File management (like product images)

üìÅ Backend Folder Breakdown
src/

This is the source directory for all server-side logic.

1. config/

Purpose: Configuration-related files for the application.

‚Ä¢ db.js

Connects to MongoDB using mongoose.

Handles connection success and error logging.

‚úÖ Example:

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, { ...options });

2. controllers/

Purpose: Contains logic for handling HTTP requests. Controllers are called from routes.

‚Ä¢ cartController.js

Handles all cart operations:

Add to cart

Remove from cart

Get user cart

‚Ä¢ orderController.js

Manages:

Placing an order

Viewing order history

Admin order control (optional)

‚Ä¢ productController.js

Handles:

Creating a product

Getting all products

Fetching a single product

Updating/deleting a product

‚Ä¢ userController.js

Handles:

Registering a user

Logging in (returns JWT)

Getting/updating user profile

Admin user operations (optional)

‚úÖ Why controllers? Keeps your route files clean and separates logic for maintainability.

3. middleware/

Purpose: Custom Express middleware for tasks like auth, error handling, etc.

üìå This folder is empty in the screenshot but is likely used for things like:

authMiddleware.js ‚Äì verify JWT tokens

errorHandler.js ‚Äì centralized error management

‚úÖ Why? Middleware lets you reuse functionality across multiple routes.

4. models/

Purpose: Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections.

‚Ä¢ User.js

Defines user schema:

Name, email, password (hashed), role, etc.

Includes pre-save middleware (e.g., password hashing)

‚Ä¢ Product.js

Defines:

Name, price, category, image, stock

Description, reviews, rating

‚Ä¢ Cart.js

Represents user's cart:

Linked to a user

Contains product references and quantities

‚Ä¢ Order.js

Represents a complete order:

User, cart items, total, payment status, shipping info

‚úÖ Why models? They provide structure to MongoDB documents and easy query methods.

5. routes/

Purpose: Defines the API endpoints and connects them to controller functions.

‚Ä¢ cartRoutes.js

Endpoints for:

/api/cart/add

/api/cart/remove

/api/cart/

‚Ä¢ orderRoutes.js

Endpoints like:

/api/orders

/api/orders/:id

‚Ä¢ productRoutes.js

Endpoints like:

GET /api/products

GET /api/products/:id

POST /api/products

‚Ä¢ userRoutes.js

Endpoints:

POST /api/users/login

POST /api/users/register

GET /api/users/profile

‚Ä¢ index.js

May be used to combine all routes and export a single router

‚úÖ Why? Keeps route definitions organized per domain (users, products, etc.)

6. utils/

Purpose: Utility/helper functions used across the app.

‚Ä¢ fileUpload.js

Configures file upload handling (e.g., using multer)

Likely used for product image uploads

‚Ä¢ generateToken.js

Generates JWT token using jsonwebtoken

Called on user login or registration

‚úÖ Why? Isolates utility logic from business logic.

7. uploads/

Purpose: Stores uploaded files (e.g., product images) from the frontend.

Must be accessible by static route like:

app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
